# FastFighter
An AIO fighter for SoulSplit 3, powered by Xobot

This script uses a task-based framework to perform actions, which makes it modular, and easy to add to. 
The priority characteristic adds a hierachical advantage, allowing for tasks with the highest priority to be performed (when multiple can be performed at the same time).
This encapsulates the nature of a fighting script (eating > praying > looting > idling > etc...)
